## How It Works

2. **Data Fetching**: Once a user connects their digital wallet, the system fetches relevant data points such as Solana balance, transaction history, and current NFT portfolio.
3. **Analysis & Categorization**: The K-Means clustering algorithm analyzes the fetched data, categorizing the user into a specific behavior pattern.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Based on the categorization, the system generates a list of the top NFTs recommended for purchase.
5. **Continuous Learning**: The model continually learns from new user data, ensuring recommendations become more accurate over time.
